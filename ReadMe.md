# Meliora LaunchPad


## Ontology

The website is about the student organization called Meliora LaunchPad at the University of Rochester. I am one of the co-founders and the current President. This website is meant to attract students who are interested in entrepreneurship or professors and other stakeholders wants to know more about the entrepreneurial community at our school.


## Taxonomy
The heading of the website is entrepreneurship at the Univesrsity of Rocehster, which informs the user that the website is about entrepreneurship. At first when they open i and if they are looking at teh top left they see the organization logo which will capture their interest. As they move right they immediately see the heading and what the club is about. The main picture is about the people leading the organization. That was placed so users can see the faces who run the club and gives them a sense of familiarity. It shows happy relaxed college students who are having fun. For a student organization that I believe is very important. As they move bottom left with the Z pattern they see our about section and what we are all about. It tells the description of the club, what our aim and goal is. 
Then is a Our Beliefs section. This is meant to allow other students and our readers what our perspective about entrepreneurship is. What our core beliefs are. I think that information is heartfelt and many would be able to relate to. So right after is the SIgn up form which is colored differently so users will feel the call to action. The next page is a titled past events, which would allow users to look what kind of events we did in the past after they got enough interest to know more about us from the landing page. The past event page uses a F pattern, with images of the flyers of our events coming to their view at first. I beleive F pattern was perfect for this page as its a lit of information, with picture, desciption and experience. It allows users to eaily naivgate through that. At the bottom is the footer where there are additional links to follow us on FB and join us on CCCC. FInally the UR logo to show our affiliation with the college


## Choreography

The order of the information is the Home page where users first learn taht we have to do with entrepreneurship, then reads our about section to know about us completely. Then the reader reads our beliefs to make a connection to their interest in entrepreneurship with us. Then we capture that momentum with the newsletter. Thn its the past event page which captures the events we did in the past showing our reader the cool work we have done so far.
