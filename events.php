					<h3>Details</h3>
					<p>The April Social is a networking event for Entrepreneurs to meet students interested in participating in the Mark Ain Business Model Competition or the Forbes Entrepreneurial Competition. 
					These two comeptitions are the biggest business competitions that are organized by the University of Rochester 
					and are usually in the Spring. One of the biggest barriers to enter the competition is finding the right team.
					That is why we organized this event in order to create networking opportunities so students can 
					step out of their circles, meet new people and participate with some cool ideas.
